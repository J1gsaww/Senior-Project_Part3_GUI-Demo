## Senior Project | Thai Hand Written Recognition using CNN (ResNet50)
This is just one part of my Senior Project, the displaying phase."

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The research team extends heartfelt thanks to everyone who supported us. 
<br> We are grateful to Assoc. Prof. Dr. Chomthip Pornpanomchai for invaluable guidance and advice, 
<br> as well as to all teachers, senior colleagues, and parents for their unwavering support

## Objectives
The goal of Thai handwritten recognition is to create technology that accurately converts handwritten Thai script into digital text. This involves using deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve accuracy. By leveraging machine learning methods and large datasets of handwritten Thai characters, we aim to develop systems capable of recognizing diverse writing styles. Ultimately, our research aims to make Thai handwritten recognition a valuable tool for various industries and individuals in the digital age.

## Displaying 
This GUI application performs Thai characters handwritten recognition using a deep learning model. 
Users can upload an image containing handwritten Thai characters, and the application predicts the characters using the trained model.

**Required library:** PIL (Python Imaging Library) 
<br>- Tkinter (Python GUI Library)
<br>- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)
<br>- OpenCV (Computer Vision Library)
<br>- Keras (Deep Learning Library)

## Features
- **Upload Image:** Allows users to upload an image file containing handwritten Thai characters.
- **Predict:** Performs character recognition on the uploaded image and displays the predicted characters.
- **Clear:** Clears the uploaded image and the prediction result.
- **Exit:** Closes the application.
